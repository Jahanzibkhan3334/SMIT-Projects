    <h3>Health Benefits of Cycling:</h3>
    <p><i>"Pedal your way to greatness—every ride is a step closer to a stronger, healthier you!"</i></p>
    <p>Cycling strengthens muscles, improves cardiovascular health, and helps maintain a healthy weight. Regular cycling can reduce the risk of chronic illnesses like heart disease, diabetes, and arthritis, and because it's a low-impact activity, it's gentle on the joints. Mental health also sees a boost—cycling outdoors has been shown to reduce stress, increase happiness, and promote a sense of well-being.</p>
     
    <h3>Eco-Friendly and Cost-Effective:</h3>
    <p>
        By choosing to cycle, individuals help reduce their carbon footprint, making it an eco-friendly transportation choice. Additionally, cycling can be cost-effective, saving money on fuel and public transportation costs while reducing traffic congestion.
