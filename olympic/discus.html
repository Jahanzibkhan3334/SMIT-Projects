        <center>The <strong>discus throw</strong> is a dynamic and powerful track and field event that challenges athletes to hurl a disc-shaped object, known as the discus, as far as possible. Combining strength, agility, and precise technique, the event is a true test of athleticism. The discus is typically crafted from wood or synthetic materials with a metal rim, weighing 2 kg for men and 1 kg for women. <img src="events_pic\discuse_throw_images\discus_techniques.jfif" width="700" alt=""> Athletes launch the discus from a 2.5-meter circular platform using a spinning motion to generate momentum, requiring exceptional balance and coordination. <img src="events_pic\discuse_throw_images\discus_techniques2.jfif" width="700" alt=""> The discus must land within a 34.92° sector to qualify as a valid throw. With roots in ancient Greece, where it was a highlight of the Olympic Games, the discus throw remains a celebrated sport in modern athletics. World-class throwers can achieve distances exceeding 70 meters, showcasing the incredible combination of speed, strength, and technical skill required to excel in this iconic event.</center>
